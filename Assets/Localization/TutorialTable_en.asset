      you need to do.\r\n\r\nDrag the objects that appear on the map to their respective
      bins.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Timer\" gamemode, recycle as many objects as possible
      in their bins to achieve a maximum score!\n \r\nIn the \"Error\" gamemode recycle
      as many objects as possible, but be careful! If you make more than three mistakes,
      you lose the game and your points. \r\n\nTo switch between game modes, visit
      the options menu!"
